# AtliQ-Grand-Analysis-BI
🌟 Thrilled to Present My Power BI Dashboard for the Hospitality Industry: AtliQ Grand! 🏨📊

**Project Overview**:
AtliQ Grand, a luxury 5-star hotel chain with locations in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, and Bangalore, has been struggling with revenue and market share despite its premium status. Using Power BI, I analyzed their data and developed actionable strategies to help them get back on track. 🚀

I created **two dashboards** tailored to their needs:

➡️ **Performance Overview**: A high-level view showcasing essential metrics like revenue, RevPAR, occupancy rates, and guest satisfaction to track business performance at a glance.

➡️ **Revenue & Booking Overview**: A detailed analysis of revenue trends, guest booking behaviour, cancellations, and city-wise performance to identify growth opportunities.

**Key Skills Used**:

🔹 Data Storytelling

🔹 Revenue & Booking Analytics

🔹 Power BI Expertise

🔹 DAX Formulas (RevPAR, ADR, and other hospitality KPIs)

🔹 I used DAX functions to analyze revenue trends by weekdays vs. weekends, helping to uncover patterns and optimize strategies for peak days.



This project was a fantastic challenge that allowed me to combine analytical skills with creativity to deliver impactful solutions.
